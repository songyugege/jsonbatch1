Cross-origin Resource Sharing


= Same-origin policy

URL                                                 Outcome              Reason
http://dltbank.com/transer/crete.html               Same origin
http://dltbank.com/transer/repot/check.html         Same origin          Only path different
http://mm.dltbank.com/transer/repot/check.html      Different origin     Different protocol
http://tha.dltbank.com:81/transer/crete.html        Different Origin     Different port ( http:// is port 80 by default )
http://news.dltbank.com:81/article.html             Different Origin     Different host


Same-origin policy is highly secure but inflexible for genius use cases.
CORS is an extension of the same-origin policy
You need CORS when you to pull data from extenal AIPs that are public or authorized or (authorized third-party acces to your own server resources)
